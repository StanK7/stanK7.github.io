        <h2>North Carolina</h2>
        <p>
          "North Carolina is a state in the Southeastern region of the United
          States. It is bordered by Virginia to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to
          the east, South Carolina to the south, Georgia to the southwest, and
          Tennessee to the west. The state is the 28th-largest and 9th-most
          populous of the United States. Along with South Carolina, it makes up
          the Carolinas region of the East Coast. At the 2020 census, the state
          had a population of 10,439,388. Raleigh is the state's capital and
          Charlotte is its most populous city. The Charlotte metropolitan area,
          with an estimated population of 2,805,115 in 2023, is the most
          populous metropolitan area in North Carolina, the 22nd-most populous
          in the United States, and the largest banking center in the nation
          after New York City. The Research Triangle, with an estimated
          population of 2,368,947 in 2023, is the second-most populous combined
          metropolitan area in the state, 31st-most populous in the United
          States, and is home to the largest research park in the United States,
          Research Triangle Park.

          The earliest evidence of human occupation in North Carolina dates back
          10,000 years, found at the Hardaway Site. North Carolina was inhabited
          by Carolina Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan speaking tribes of
          Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans. King Charles II
          granted eight lord proprietors a colony they named Carolina after the
          king and which was established in 1670 with the first permanent
          settlement at Charles Town (Charleston). Because of the difficulty of
          governing the entire colony from Charles Town, the colony was
          eventually divided and North Carolina was established as a royal
          colony in 1729 and was one of the Thirteen Colonies. The Halifax
          Resolves resolution adopted by North Carolina on April 12, 1776, was
          the first formal call for independence from Great Britain among the
          American Colonies during the American Revolution.

          On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify
          the United States Constitution. In the run-up to the American Civil
          War, North Carolina declared its secession from the Union on May 20,
          1861, becoming the tenth of eleven states to join the Confederate
          States of America. Following the Civil War, the state was restored to
          the Union on July 4, 1868. On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur
          Wright successfully piloted the world's first controlled, sustained
          flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft at Kitty Hawk in North
          Carolina's Outer Banks. North Carolina often uses the slogan 'First in
          Flight' on state license plates to commemorate this achievement,
          alongside a newer alternative design bearing the slogan 'First in
          Freedom' in reference to the Mecklenburg Declaration and Halifax
          Resolves.

          North Carolina is defined by a wide range of elevations and
          landscapes. From west to east, North Carolina's elevation descends
          from the Appalachian Mountains to the Piedmont and Atlantic coastal
          plain. North Carolina's Mount Mitchell at 6,684 ft (2,037 m) is the
          highest point in North America east of the Mississippi River. Most of
          the state falls in the humid subtropical climate zone; however, the
          western, mountainous part of the state has a subtropical highland
          climate." (<a
