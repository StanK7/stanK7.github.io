        <h1>About Taniti</h1>
        <p>
          Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island
          has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
          includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
          tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a
          small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
          20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian
          economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
        </p>

        <h2>Transportation Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
          small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per
          week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small
          jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the
          airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
          next few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ground transportation options include public buses serving Taniti City
          and running from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day, private buses serving
          the rest of the island, taxis available in Taniti City, and rental
          cars from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets
          are available to rent from several vendors. Taniti City is fairly flat
          and very walkable, and many tourists stay in the area surrounding
          Merriton Landing, which is easy to explore on foot.
