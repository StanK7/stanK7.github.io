        <h2>Greensboro</h2>
        <p>
          Greensboro local pronunciation is a city in and the county seat of
          Guilford County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census,
          its population was 299,035; it was estimated to be 302,296 in 2023. It
          is the third-most populous city in North Carolina after Charlotte and
          Raleigh and the 69th-most populous city in the United States. The
          population of the Greensboro-High Point, NC Metropolitan Statistical
          Area was estimated to be 789,842 in 2023. The Piedmont Triad region,
          of which Greensboro is the most populous city, had an estimated
          population of 1,736,099 in 2023.

          In 1808, Greensboro was planned around a central courthouse square to
          succeed Guilford Court House as the county seat. The county courts
          were thus placed closer to the county's geographical center, a
          location more easily reached at the time by the majority of the
          county's citizens, who traveled by horse or on foot. Three major
          Interstate Highways (Interstate 40, Interstate 85, and Interstate 73)
          in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina were built to
          intersect at this city.

          Among Greensboro's many notable attractions, some of the most popular
          are the Greensboro Science Center, the International Civil Rights
          Museum, The Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, the
          Weatherspoon Art Museum, the Greensboro Symphony, and the Greensboro
          Ballet. Annual events in the city include the North Carolina Folk
          Festival, First Fridays in Downtown Greensboro, Fun Fourth of July
          Festival, North Carolina Comedy Festival, and Winter Wonderlights.
          From 2015 to 2017, Greensboro hosted the National Folk Festival.

          The Greensboro Coliseum Complex hosts a variety of major sporting
          events, concerts, and other events, including the ACC men's basketball
          tournament and women's basketball tournament. Local professional teams
          include the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic Baseball
          League, the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League, and the
          semi-professional Carolina Dynamo soccer club of USL League Two.
          Amateur teams include Greensboro Roller Derby and college teams in
          four NCAA programs. The Sedgefield Country Club is currently host to
          the annual PGA Tour event Wyndham Golf Championship. Greensboro would
          serve as the Atlantic Coast Conference headquarters for 70 years,
          until the league relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2023.
