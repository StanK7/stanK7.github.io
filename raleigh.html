        <h2>Raleigh</h2>
        <p>
          "Raleigh is the capital city of the U.S. state of North Carolina and
          the seat of Wake County. It is the second-most populous city in North
          Carolina, after Charlotte. Raleigh is the tenth-most populous city in
          the Southeast, the 41st-most populous city in the U.S., and the
          largest city of the Research Triangle metro area. Raleigh is known as
          the 'City of Oaks' for its many oak trees, which line the streets in
          the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 148.54 square
          miles (384.7 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau counted the city's
          population as 467,665 at the 2020 census. It is one of the
          fastest-growing cities in the United States. The city of Raleigh is
          named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the now-lost Roanoke
          Colony in present-day Dare County.
        </p>

          Raleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NC State or NCSU)
          and is part of the Research Triangle together with Durham (home of
          Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill
          (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The name of
          the Research Triangle (often shortened to 'The Triangle') originated
          after the 1959 creation of Research Triangle Park (RTP), located in
          Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and universities. The
          Triangle encompasses the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical
          Area, which had an estimated population of 2,368,947 in 2023. The
          Raleigh-Cary, NC Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated
          population of 1,509,231 in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a small portion
          extending into Durham County. The towns of Apex, Cary, Clayton,
          Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Morrisville,
          Rolesville, Wake Forest, Wendell, and Zebulon are some of Raleigh's
          primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.

          Raleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city.
          Following the American Revolutionary War when the U.S. gained
          independence, the area was chosen as the site of the state capital in
          1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid
          out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol at the
          center, in Union Square. During the American Civil War, the city was
          spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the
          closing days of the war and struggled with the economic hardships in
          the postwar period, related to the reconstitution of labor markets,
          over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the
          Reconstruction Era. The establishment of the Research Triangle Park
          (RTP) in 1959 helped create tens of thousands of jobs in the fields of
          science and technology. By the early 21st century, Raleigh had become
          one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States." (<a
